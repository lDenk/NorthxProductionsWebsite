- get lookbook pictures in home page; still waiting on Jack and Joe to provide these pictures
- homepage could also be anything they are pushing at the time.  Might be easiest if we just remake home page whenever
	they want it to be changed.

- make a "featured" video section on the videos page; maybe above the playlists?
	this will require Jack or Joe to make a "featured" playlist
	I was thinking we could grab the playlist id and filter that out when parsing videos in loadPlaylists
	(did jack and joe ask for this? was thinking maybe we have them check out the videos page and tell us what they want)
- make sure everything plays nicely with mobile

- figure out where we want social media icons

- TO PAUL:
- in the loadPlaylists() function on the videos index page can we add a condition to make sure a playlist
	has at least one video before we add it too the page.  Looking at that playlist "x", not sure what that is.
	- This will require radical changes to the code.  It can be done, but I need to set aside a chunk of time to do it.
- also, maybe we should wait to load the videos until their carot is clicked.  not sure how hard this will be.  
	wanted to wait for you to get back before making any changes to the javascript.  just worried that -once there
	are more videos- the page will take too long to load.

Things that are done, but want to keep around for reminders/notes:

- change font
	- change font is done, but I'm not sure if it is the font we want
- automatically get youtube videos; the following indents are notes for completed youtube work, so you don't need to pay much attention to them
	https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/authentication - we're going to need to get the authorization completed
	We'll then have to query for playlist ids use the mine parameter: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/playlists/list
	Then we'll query for all of the playlist's items for each playlist id: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/playlistItems/list
	Input in url for testing:

- give space between store items/restrict store item space; the names of adjacent items run into each other?

- make northx logo clickable to return to home page
- badger Jack and Joe about what we're going to do with the music page
- get social media icons onto the page in the upper right hand corner or something like that
- copy pdf layout (see folder where TODO.txt resides for pdf layout)

	the user can see the top of the first video for each playlist
- setup store page with pictures and prices and all that jazz
